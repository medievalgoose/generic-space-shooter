# Brief Explanation
This is a demo project I made as an introduction to Godot 3.5 with C#. As the name suggests, it is a generic space shooter game with minimal features. The game is simple, where you can move the player with WASD or arrow keys and shoot with left mouse button. Enemies will spawn randomly, and your mission is to avoid getting 'touched' by them.

Since it's using C#, you need to use Godot with Mono support.

# How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open godot and import the project by choosing 'project.godot' file from the cloned repository.
3. Build and run the game.
